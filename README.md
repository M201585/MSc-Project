# MSc-Project
For this code comment matching task, an ablation study is apply to
a NL-PL pretrained model, CodeBERT, to analyze which layers of the model are more
important for Code Comment Matching task. Afterwards, a modified CodeBERT-based
network is built, which makes the model smaller ,more efficient and more effective.

# Installation
This repository is tested on Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.11.0, transformers 4.20.1 and tqdm 4.64.0 with GPU Tesla V100.

First, create a virtual environment with the version of Python 3.7.

Second, you should install PyTorch 1.11.0, transformers 4.20.1 and tqdm 4.64.0 in a virtual environment. 

For example,

```
conda install pytorch==1.11.0
```
